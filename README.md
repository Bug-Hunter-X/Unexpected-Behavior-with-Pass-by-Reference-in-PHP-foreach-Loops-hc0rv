# PHP Foreach Loop Pass-by-Reference Bug
This example demonstrates a common issue in PHP related to pass-by-reference in `foreach` loops.  Modifying values within the loop directly modifies the original array elements, potentially leading to unexpected results if not handled with caution.

The `bug.php` file contains code that illustrates this issue, while `bugSolution.php` presents a corrected version.
